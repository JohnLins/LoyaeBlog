Itâ€™s 2024, ensuring accessibility for all users is important. One crucial aspect of web accessibility is the inclusion of alternative text, or alt text, for images. However, manually adding alt text to images can be a time-consuming and labor-intensive task. We will explore the benefits of incorporating alt text into your website and suggest a cost-effective solution that leverages AI to do it automatically (for WordPress users).

<br/><br/>
<h2>Enhancing Accessibility</h2><br/>
Alt text serves as a textual description of images, enabling individuals with visual impairments or those using assistive technologies to understand the visual content of a webpage. By incorporating alt text, website owners contribute to a more inclusive online environment, ensuring that all users can access and comprehend the information presented. It is a simple yet powerful way to provide equal access to individuals with disabilities, fostering a more inclusive and diverse digital space.
<br/><br/>

<h2>Time and Cost Efficiency</h2><br/>
Traditionally, adding alt text to images has been a manual and time-consuming process, especially for websites with numerous images or frequent updates. The manual nature of this task can be burdensome, diverting resources away from other important aspects of website management. Loyae, an automated solution powered by machine learning, it streamlines the alt text generation and insertion process, significantly reducing the time and effort required. This automation allows website owners to allocate resources efficiently and focus on other critical aspects of their digital presence.
<br/><br/>
